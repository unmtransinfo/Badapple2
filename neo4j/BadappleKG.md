# BadappleKG

The code here is for a Neo4j knowledge graph representation of the Badapple
db, currently generated via ETL from the PostgreSQL version. Via graph
analytics, Cypher queries, and the visualizations and interpretability
of Neo4j KGs, this BadappleKG is intended to provide additional functionality
and value.
